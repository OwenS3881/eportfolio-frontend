        As I am only just beginning my work in UF's University Research Scholars
        Program (URSP), I am yet to conduct any actual research. However, I am
        taking Research and Creativity this semester and will take a
        Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) class next
        semester. So check back at a later date to see my future research!
